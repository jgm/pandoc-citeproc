pandoc-citeproc (0.3)

  * Removed biblio2yaml.  Instead, use pandoc-citeproc with the
    --bib2yaml or --bib2json option.  (#20)
  * pandoc-citeproc --bib2json will convert bibtex/biblatex to
    CSL compatible JSON bibliographies.
  * Updated locale files for correct textual date ranges
    in e.g. the da-DK locale.  Use form="ordinal" instead of a period
    as suffix.  (#16, #18)
  * Support new langid and langidopts biblatex fields. (#11)
  * Made test-pandoc-citeproc work in all locales. (#19)
    It now tests the executable rather than the library function.
  * Fixed disambiguation with multivolume works (#14).
  * Improved titlecase/unTitlecase to be sensitive to colons,
    question marks, and exclamation marks, after which the
    next character sohuld be capitalized even in sentence case
    (pandoc #1102).
  * The "locale" filed in metadata will now override a style's
    default locale.  This can also be set by the command line:
    --metadata locale=fr-FR (#10).
  * Use CSL-compatible date-parts for dates in YAML/JSON
    bibliographies.
  * Made FromJSON for Reference more forgiving.  Suitable strings
    are coerced into integer values.  (pandoc #1094)
  * Fixed extra punctuation at end of footnote (#13).
  * Reference:  Always use array in JSON for dates, agents.
  * Bibtex parser:  Don't fail on entry with no title.
  * Bibliography output: 'given' is now a string, not an array.
    The string will be split on spaces into a list of given names.
    Note that an array can also be used.  But we write
    a plain string, to match the  citeproc json schema.
  * Fixed spacing bug in date ranges (#7).
  * Names:  Fixed formatLabel so it works for editortranslator.
    This fixes a bug for cases where editor = translator (#9).
  * Text.CSL.Eval.Date:  Fixed bugs with date ranges.
    Ranges within the same year were raising an error "Prelude.init: empty
    list" (#7).
  * Util: Export tr' and init'.
  * Text.CSL.Proc.Disamb:  Correct definition of allTheSame.
  * Improved disambiguation.  Now we correctly handle the case with no
    author but title.
  * Consider names too when determining date disambiguations.
    Previously if you had two distinct names needing disambiguation for
    the same date, the letters would not start over with 'a' for the second
    name.
  * Added Generic instances for the types in Style and Reference.
