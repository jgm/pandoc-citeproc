Chiu, W. W., & Chow, W. M. (1978). *A hybrid hierarchical model of a
multiple virtual storage (MVS) operating system* (research report No.
RC-6947). IBM.


NOTES:

- biblio2yaml
	- "MVS", when not wrapped in {}, gives "mVS", which is probably never intended, or useful (latex converts the whole word to lowercase if unprotected ("MVS" -> "mvs"))
