\mkbibquote{} should be replaced by a matching set of quotation marks that can be used by citeproc for quote substitution and flipflopping. English smart double quotation marks seem best, as they cannot be confused with apostrophes.

\enquote{}, \enquote*{} should be replaced by a matching set of quotation marks, too: “foo”, ‘bar’.
