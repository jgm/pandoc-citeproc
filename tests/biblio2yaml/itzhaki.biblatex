Itzhaki, N. (1996, March 11). Some remarks on ’t Hooft’s S-matrix for
black holes.


NOTES:

- biblio2yaml:
	- eprinttype = {arxiv}, eprint = {hep-th/9603067}, 
	  should be converted to a url: http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9603067
	  (prefix http://arxiv.org/abs/ seems to work for all arxiv material)

- citeproc:
	- obtaining correct case of "'t Hooft's" in title is possible but awkward:
	  '{t Hooft's} works; {'t Hooft}'s or '{t Hooft}'s do not

}
