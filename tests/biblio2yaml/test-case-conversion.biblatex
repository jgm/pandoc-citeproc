        - expect titles in title case
        - styles use titles as is, or convert them to sentence case
        - strings wrapped {} are not converted
    - all CSL styles at <http://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>
      and <https://www.zotero.org/styles/>
        - expect titles in sentence case
        - styles use titles as is, or convert them to title case
        - except for (hardcoded) list of stop words, see
          <http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#title-case-conversion>
        - citeproc-js (MLZ only?) also recognizes a markup syntax for
          suppressing title-case changes on a range of text (see
          <https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/21991/excessive-capitalization-of-citation-titles/#Item_22>):
            - `<span class="nocase"/>lowercase</span>`
    - Proposal:
        - When converting to yaml, convert English titles to sentence case,
            - for all strings wrapped in {} where {} is not part of a latex
              command, ...
            - ... when starting with an uppercase letter: suppress
conversion, remove the {}
            - ... when starting with a lowercase letter ("nm", "iPod"):
              suppress conversion, replace the {} with
              <span class="nocase"/></span>
            - Note: Camel case ("iPod") needs to be protected in
              bibtex/biblatex anyway; the only "extension" (wrt bibtex/biblatex
              specs) we'd be introducing is wrapping lowercase-only strings in
              {}, something that is never necessary on the latex side but
              won't break anything there either.
        - citeproc-hs/pandoc-citeproc should be modified to honour this new
          syntax and suppress conversion to title case for strings wrapped
          in `<span class="nocase"/></span>`.
        - Expected output, using one of the title-case CSL styles, here
          chicago-author-date.csl:
